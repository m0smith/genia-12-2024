# Immediate needs
## AWK Mode
- a named code block that shares variables.  Can be called just like a function but does not create a closure

## Lists
- A predicate that checks if a list contains an element
- a distinct function for lists

# Implemented
- Regex matching operator ~ and defining regex
- In awk mode, when there are no statements, execute a function called body if it exists

# Near future
- Truthyness
- A way to create a variable similar to Clojure delay but built-in so it doesn't have to be deref
- Pipelines
