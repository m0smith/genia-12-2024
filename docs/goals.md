# Project Goals

This document highlights the guiding principles behind GENIA's design.

## Ease of Learning

GENIA aims to be approachable for users with little to no programming experience. The syntax favors clear, minimal constructs so that new users can start writing useful scripts quickly.

## AI Integration

The language is designed with both external AI assistance and internal AI features in mind. Its structures are intended to be straightforward for an AI partner to reason about while still remaining easy for humans to read and modify.

## Bootstrappable Core

Only a small core language is implemented in the interpreter itself. Higher-level features are planned to be built as macros so that GENIA can grow organically from a minimal base.
